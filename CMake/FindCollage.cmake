# - Find Collage
# This module searches for the Collage library
#    See http://www.libcollage.net
#
#==================================
#
# The following environment variables are respected for finding Collage.
# CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH can also be used for this (see find_library() CMake
# documentation).
#
#    CO_ROOT
#    EQ_ROOT
#
# This module defines the following output variables:
#
#    COLLAGE_FOUND - Was Collage and all of the specified components found?
#
#    COLLAGE_VERSION - The version of Collage which was found
#
#    COLLAGE_VERSION_ABI - The DSO version of Collage which was found
#
#    COLLAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS - Where to find the headers
#
#    COLLAGE_LIBRARIES - The Collage libraries
#
#==================================
# Example Usage:
#
#  find_package(Collage 0.3.0 REQUIRED)
#  include_directories(${COLLAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS})
#
#  add_executable(foo foo.cc)
#  target_link_libraries(foo ${COLLAGE_LIBRARIES})
#
#==================================
# Naming convention:
#  Local variables of the form _co_foo
#  Input variables of the form Collage_FOO
#  Output variables of the form COLLAGE_FOO
#

#
# find and parse co/version.h
